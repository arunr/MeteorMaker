MeteorMaker
===========

This is a site where you can:

* Learn Meteor in easy to follow steps – just copy the code, read the notes and you’re on your way!
* Track your progress as you go along – check-off items that are done (especially after signing-in through Facebook).
* Share your own snippets of Meteor wisdom with the world at large.

The system is right now really basic, which reflects my understanding of Meteor – but it’s on GitHub, so help me improve it by forking the source and adding to it. Features I’d like to add are, and am in the process of adding (when I get the time!) are:

* Ability to edit and delete snippets (this is fairly trivial, just haven’t had the time to get to this yet).
* Adding a way for people to:

    + Up-vote good snippets
    + Mark the difficulty of snippets on a range of 1 to 5
    + Add tags to snippets

* Ability to sort by time, difficulty or rating.
* Ability to search by full-text or by tag.
* Ability to click on a tag and filter only those items.
* Adding a Gravatar for each snippet to show the picture of the person who has posted it.
* Having an admin console for reviewing items and approving them.
* Ability to add pictures to improve the snippets.
